\title{Get Growth Distribution Projection Sequence}
\usage{
getGrowthDistributionProjectionSequence(growth.distribution, years.projected)
}
\arguments{
\item{growth.distribution}{A list or character string specifying the growth distribution(s) to use:
\itemize{
  \item If a single distribution is provided, it will be used for all projection years
  \item If multiple distributions are provided, they should match the number of projection years
  \item Each distribution element can be either:
    \itemize{
      \item A character string indicating the distribution (e.g., "SGP_UNIFORM_RANDOM", "SGP_50", "SGP_1", "SGP_99")
      \item A list with components:
        \itemize{
          \item Distribution: (Required) The distribution type or variable name
          \item Parameters: (Optional) Distribution-specific parameters as a list
          \item Subgroups: (Optional) Variable name for subgroup analysis
        }
    }
}}

\item{years.projected}{Integer indicating the number of years to project growth distributions}
}
\value{
A list containing validated growth distribution specifications for each projection year:
  \itemize{
    \item Distribution: The specified distribution type
    \item Parameters: Distribution parameters (with defaults if not specified)
    \item Subgroups: Subgroup specifications (if provided)
  }
}
\description{
The function get.growth.distribution.projection.sequence takes the growth.distribution, validates it, and
produces a list which exactly specifies the way in which growth is assigned to student trajectories
The argument growth.distribution is specified either as a single argument for use with ALL years of the projection sequence or each year specifically.
If only one year is specified in the growth distribution, then that distribution is utilized across each year of the projection. 
Each element of the growth.distribution argument is a character string indicating the distribution from which to sample (using default parameters for the distribution)
or a list containing the following components:
     Distribution: (Required) The distribution associated with the growth distribution (either a theoretical distribution (e.g., SGP_UNIFORM_RANDOM) or a variable name (e.g., SGP_BASELINE) indicating the values to sample from.)
     Parameters: (Optional) Distribution specific parameters, (formatted as a list) to pass to the distribution being used (e.g., min, max of the SGP_UNIFORM_RANDOM distribution)
     Subgroups: (Optional) Dataset variable indicating subgroup to apply growth distribution by (e.g., SCHOOL_NUMBER)
